# Little Python Goodies
In this repository I store some random python codes.
Some of them are from Udemy 100 days of code, some of the are from other courses and my dead projects.

In [Kaggle](https://github.com/pviktor14/little_python_goodies/tree/main/Kaggle) you can find some of my solutions for Kaggle competitions (Deep Learning, Machine Learning projects).
